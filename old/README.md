# Dictionary

This project is an English Dictionary that uses the [WordsAPI](https://www.wordsapi.com/) information to display the results. It has a random word button and stores the last 10 searches. The project is also a PWA that can be installed into browsers and mobile phones.


## Requirements

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 10.15.x


## Getting started

Clone this repository with `git clone`, or download a .zip file using the top right green button.

Using the Terminal, navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`.


## Features

* Uses [Angular](https://angular.io/) as a JS framework.
* Uses some features from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and some components from [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) as a CSS framework.
* The project is a PWA.
* NPM scripts for fast development and production build (see Commands below).


### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run start` | Runs a local web server for development and opens the browser to display it. Automatically compiles styles and scripts whenever a file in `src/` is changed, and live reloads the browser. This is what *must be run* on the development stage. |
| `npm run build` | Compiles, minifies and optimizes the project. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. These files are the ones that must be used to deploy on production. |
